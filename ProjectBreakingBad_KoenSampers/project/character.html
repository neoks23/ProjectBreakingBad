                            also known by his clandestine pseudonym
                            "Heisenberg", is the main protagonist of 
                            Breaking Bad. <br><br>He was a chemist and a former<br>
                            chemistry teacher in Albuquerque, New Mexico, 
                            who, after being diagnosed with Stage 3A 
                            inoperable lung cancer, started manufacturing
                            crystal methamphetamine to both pay for his

                            portrayed as a protagonist, antagonist and antihero.<br><br>
                            As the series progresses, Walter gradually 
                            becomes darker and takes on a more villainous role.

                            Jesse Bruce Pinkman is the deuteragonist of Breaking Bad.
                            He is the former
                            partner of Walter White in the methamphetamine drug trade.
                            Jesse was a small-time methamphetamine user, manufacturer,
                            and dealer. He was also an inattentive student in Walter
                            White's chemistry class, leading to his dropping out. <br><br>In
                            his mid-20s, Jesse became Walt's business partner in the
                            meth trade.Walt insisted on making a pure product, however,
                            and thus eschewed the chili powder altogether, patronizingly 
                            teaching Jesse how to make "proper" meth.<br><br>
                            Walt often treated Jesse like a 
                            foolish son in constant need of stern correction. Jesse's 
                            own family kicked him out because of his drug use. Despite 
                            the friction between them, he and Walt have a deep bond of loyalty

                            Gustavo "Gus" Fring is a <br> Chilean-born Albuquerque
                            restaurateur, mob boss, business magnate, and 
                            philanthropist. He was the respected proprietor of
                            Los Pollos Hermanos, a highly successful restaurant
                            chain.<br><br> However, despite outward appearances, Gus
                            was a major drug kingpin initially affiliated with
                            the Mexican Juárez Cartel, secretly using his 
                            restaurant as a legitimate cover for methamphetamine
                            distribution throughout the American southwest.<br><br> 
                            Like Walter White, Gus was a criminal who "hid in 
                            plain sight", using his anti-drug philanthropy to 
                            conceal his true nature and build his illicit drug 
                            empire step by step.

                            Michael "Mike" Ehrmantraut was a former corrupt
                            police officer who,<br> after being forced to leave<br>
                            the police department, used his connections in
                            the criminal underworld to eventually become
                            Gustavo Fring's right-hand man.<br><br> Despite his
                            responsibilities as the second-in-command of the
                            mob, he occasionally carried out favours for his
                            lawyer and old associate Saul Goodman as a private
                            investigator, cleaner, and fixer, out of loyalty
                            to Saul (they had known each other for six years).<br><br>
                            Prior to his involvement in Gus's operation,<br>
                            Mike worked as parking ticket booth operator at a 
                            local courthouse, where he met Saul, then known as
                            Jimmy McGill.

                            James Morgan "Jimmy" McGill, better known
                            by his professional alias Saul Goodman,
                            is the former principal attorney of Saul
                            Goodman & Associates. He operated out of
                            a cheap strip mall office and ran 
                            over-the-top late night TV commercials 
                            advising potential clients to "Better Call Saul"
                            when in trouble with the law. While his ads 
                            seemed tacky and cheap, Saul was an effective 
                            lawyer, using illegal tactics and dirty schemes 
                            to get his clients released or acquitted.<br><br>

                            Saul was born in Cicero, Illinois as James Morgan
                            "Jimmy" McGill. <br>His older brother Chuck became<br> a
                            successful lawyer as one of the partners at an
                            Albuquerque law firm, Hamlin, Hamlin & McGill.
                            Jimmy became a scam artist in Cicero and soon 
                            gained the nickname "Slippin' Jimmy" for staging
                            "slip and fall" <br>accidents to make quick cash.
