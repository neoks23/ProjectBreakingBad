                    The network ordered nine episodes for the first season (including the pilot),
                    but the 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike limited the production to seven
                    episodes. Within the original nine-episode arc, he had planned to kill off 
                    Jesse or Hank, as a "ballsy" moment to end the season on.This death was eliminated
                    with the limited episode count, which Gilligan found to be a net positive given
                    the strength of acting that both Paul and Norris brought to these roles through
                    the seasons. The strike also helped to slow down production long enough for Gilligan
                    and his writing team to readjust the pacing of the show, which in the original arc 
                    had been moving too quickly.

                    The initial versions of the script were set in Riverside, California, but at the 
                    suggestion of Sony, Albuquerque was chosen for the production's location due to the
                    favorable financial conditions offered by the state of New Mexico. Once Gilligan 
                    recognized that this would mean "we'd always have to be avoiding the Sandia Mountains"
                    in shots directed toward the east, the story setting was changed to the actual 
                    production location. It was shot primarily on 35 mm film, with digital
                    cameras employed as needed for additional angles, point of view shots and time-lapse photography.
                    Breaking Bad cost $3 million per episode to produce, higher than the average cost for a basic cable program.

                    Around 2010, AMC had expressed to Sony Pictures Television and Gilligan that they felt that the third season
                    would be the last for Breaking Bad. Sony started to shop the show around, having gained quick interest from the
                    FX network for two more seasons, upon which AMC changed its mind and allowed the show to continue. At the same time,
                    Netflix was starting to aggressively shop for content to add to its service, and arranged a deal with Sony for
                    Breaking Bad to be available after the airing of the fourth season. However, knowing that AMC had placed Breaking Bad
                    on a potential cancellation route, Sony pushed to have the show added to the service in time for the fourth season.
                    Because of this, Breaking Bad's viewership grew greatly as viewers binged the series on Netflix, helping to assure that
                    a fifth season could be made. The fifth-season premiere had more than double the viewership compared to the fourth season
                    premiere, attributed to the Netflix availability.

                    As the series progressed, Gilligan and the writing staff of Breaking Bad made Walter increasingly unsympathetic. Gilligan
                    said during the run of the series, "He's going from being a protagonist to an antagonist. We want to make people question
                    who they're pulling for, and why." Cranston said by the fourth season, "I think Walt's figured out it's better to be a 
                    pursuer than the pursued. He's well on his way to badass."
                    <br><br>
                    In July 2011, Vince Gilligan indicated that he intended to conclude Breaking Bad at the end of its fifth season.
                    In early August 2011, negotiations began over a deal regarding the fifth and possible final season between the network AMC
                    and Sony Pictures Television, the production company of the series. AMC proposed a shortened fifth season
                    (six to eight episodes, instead of 13) to cut costs, but the producers declined. Sony then approached other cable networks
                    about possibly picking up the show if a deal could not be made. On August 14, 2011, AMC renewed the series 
                    for a fifth and final season consisting of 16 episodes.

                    Before the series finale, Gilligan said that it was difficult to write for Walter White because the character
                    was so dark and morally questionable: "I'm going to miss the show when it's over, but on some level,
                    it'll be a relief to not have Walt in my head anymore." Gilligan later said the idea for Walter's 
                    character intrigued him so much that he "didn't really give much thought on how well it would sell", 
                    stating that he would have given up on the premise since it was "such an odd, dark story" that could have difficulties
                    being pitched to studios.
